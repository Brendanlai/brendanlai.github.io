								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/headshot_sqre.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A recently graduated Integrated Engineering student from UBC, I'm a results oriented yet process driven individual with a passion for maximizing outcomes through data driven decision making. I hope to leverage my analytical, problem-solving, and collaborative skills to deliver meaningful lasting impacts while satisfying my passion for learning.
								<p>Currently, I've been working part-time at BC Children's Hospital supporting quality improvement projects and particularly surgical site infection prevention practices. To date, we've helped increase adherence rates hospital wide in skin cleaning and antibiotic timing; two methods related to SSI prevention and are excited to continue improving these rates for other methods such as normothermia and discharge teaching.
								</p>
								</p>Some programming languages and technologies I am most proficient with include: <br> <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-ca/">PowerBI</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a>,  <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://www.katalon.com/"> Katalon</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a><div class=""></div> 
								</p>
								<p>On a more personal level, I love sports. Particularly, hockey and soccer which I played competitively throughout my youth and high school. From this passion I also have a deep love hate relationship with fantasy sports. Two other activities which I picked up through the pandemic and are increasingly growing as favourite past times are golf and running. I also love music and spoiler alert, you can see more on how I used that passion to develop a music sharing application in my projects section. <br> Feel free to add me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/63912918">Strava</a> &#127939 or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/c7ll7kx6vtwmfli6ntsid5emq">Spotify</a> &#127925
								</p>
								<p>"It takes a village to raise a child" is an African proverb and one of my favourite quotes. A big believer in the value of team and surrounding myself with outstanding people I strive to be that excellent team member or friend that everyone is grateful to have.

								<p>I spent 8 (September 2021 to April 2022) months as a BSA (Business System Analyst) at CIBC where I continually improved my understanding	of project management, managing process transformation, and driving process improvements. I’m pleased to say my hard work was also recognized as I was nominated and received the CIBC Exceptional Co-op Student Award (~20 out of 500+ students).

								<p>Over the 2021 summer I interned at MDA (Macdonald Dettwiler and Associates) for the geointellgience division where I was a Software Test Engineer. At MDA I spent my time developing automated web applicaiton tests and API testing. Here I improved my abilities in end to end test automation using the <a href="https://cucumber.io/tools/cucumberstudio/">cucumber</a> framework through <a href="https://katalon.com/">Katalon Studio</a>.

								<p>My final capstone project was proposed by myself and completed alongisde 5 other outstanding individuals. We developed an autonomous robotic foosball opponent which anyone could walk up and play against. Below is a demo video of our project on the final presentation day.

								<p>In my third year capstone project myself and a five others created overlap. Overlap is a Spotify integrated web application that collects the users listening data creating fun visualizations for the user to understand their own listening habits. The other key feature we built was the group sharing capabilities to compare your listening habits to your friends. You can view the project source code <a href="https://github.com/IGEN330-Overlap/Overlap">here</a> and learn more about it in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7xzm9jY6b0">video</a>

								</span>
								<p>For my second year capstone project I alongside my team designed a solar powered path/stret light. Unfortunately, we were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and shifted towards developing a full scale CAD model. As team lead for Solit I was responible for CAD reviews and lead the system simulation. The other notable contribution I made was programming components such as our data logger and battery and solar management system.
