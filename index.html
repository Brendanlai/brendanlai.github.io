								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/headshot_sqre.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A recently graduated Integrated Engineering student at UBC with a focus on computer engineering and engineering physics I hope to leverage these skills in the software engineering or data science fields in the future.
								</p>Some programming Languages and technologies I am most proficient with include: <br> <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-ca/">PowerBI</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://www.katalon.com/"> Katalon</a>(end to end test automation),  RESTful APIs,  and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a><div class=""></div> <br>Beyond these tools I also have intermediate experience with backend development, JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.
								</p>
								<p>On a more personal level, I love sports. Particularly, hockey and soccer which I played competitively throughout my youth and high school. From this passion I also have a deep love hate relationship with fantasy sports. Two other activities which I picked up through the pandemic and are increasingly growing as favourite past times are golf and running. A 'fun' fact is I recently ran the Vancouver Marathon :). I also love music and spoiler alert, you can see more on how I used that passion to develop a music sharing application in my projects section. <br> Feel free to add me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/63912918">Strava</a> &#127939 or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/c7ll7kx6vtwmfli6ntsid5emq">Spotify</a> &#127925
								</p>
								<p>"It takes a village to raise a child" is an African proverb and one of my favourite quotes. A big believer in the value of team and surrounding myself with outstanding people I strive to be that excellent team member or friend that everyone is grateful to have.

									<a href="https://bcchr.ca/dhil/about-us"><img src="/images/BCCHR_logo.png" alt="" /></a>
								</span>
								<p>At BC Children’s I have worked under the supervision of Dr. Matthias Goerges in the digital health innovation lab in both full and part time capacity specializing in data visualizations supporting anesthesiologists.
								</p>
								<br>
									Skills: PowerBI • Python • Jupyter • Data Visualization • Data Analysis • MQuery
								</br>
								<br>At BC Children's I have worked mainly on 4 different initiatives. For the POFU (Post Operative Follow Up) dashboards I co-designed and developed major changes to the original deployment improving dashboard usability. I also, developed python scripts to automate data analysis steps for the POQI research study. Lastly, for both PeDI (Pediactric direct intubation) and NSQIP (National surgical quality improvement program) I have been involved from the beginning as the main developer of dashboards for quality improvmenet and quality of care initiatives.

								<p>I spent 8 (September 2021 to April 2022) months as a BSA (Business System Analyst) at CIBC where I continually improved my understanding	of project portfolio management and managing process transformation and improvements. I’m pleased to say my hard work was also recognized as I was nominated and received the CIBC Exceptional Co-op Student Award (~40 out of 500+ students).
								</p>
								<br>
									Skills: Tableau • Python • Alteryx • Project Management • Data Analysis • Task Automation

								</span>
								<p>Over the 2021 summer I interned at MDA (Macdonald Dettwiler and Associates) for the geointellgience division where I was a Software Test Engineer. At MDA I spent my time developing automated web applicaiton tests and API testing. Here I improved my abilities in end to end test automation using the <a href="https://cucumber.io/tools/cucumberstudio/">cucumber</a> framework through Katalon Studio.

								</span>	
								<p>My final capstone project was proposed by myself and completed alongisde 5 other outstanding individuals. We developed an autonomous robotic foosball opponent which anyone could walk up and play against. Please see our drive for more media and you can reference our poster for how it worked <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FNWNzub9BFkjC3ssFo5zJb3rbLoISCuC">here</a>

								</span>	
								<p>In my third year capstone project myself and a five others created overlap. Overlap is a Spotify integrated web application that collects the users listening data creating fun visualizations for the user to understand their own listening habits. The other key feature we built was the group sharing capabilities to compare your listening habits to your friends. At Overlap I lead the backend team designing and coding our middleware functions, database schemas, and algorithm development for calculating favourites and generating playlists. <br>You can view the project source code <a href="https://github.com/IGEN330-Overlap/Overlap">here</a> and learn more about it in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7xzm9jY6b0">video</a>

								</span>
								<p>For my second year capstone project I alongside my team designed a solar powered path/stret light. Unfortunately, we were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and shifted towards developing a full scale CAD model. As team lead for Solit I was responible for CAD reviews and lead the system simulation. The other notable contribution I made was programming components such as our data logger and battery and solar management system.
