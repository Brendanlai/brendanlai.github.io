				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/headshot_sqre.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Currently I'm working at GGPoker as a Business Intellgience Analyst.
					A recently graduated Integrated Engineering student from UBC, I'm passionate about maximizing outcomes through data driven decision making. I hope
					to leverage my analytical, problem-solving, and collaborative skills to deliver meaningful impacts
					while satisfying my love for learning.
				</p>
				<p>	Between graduating and GGPoker I worked part-time at BC Children's Hospital supporting quality improvement
					projects and particularly surgical site infection prevention practices. In this role I helped
					increase SSI prevention rates hospital wide by raising awareness for prevention methods like skin cleaning, antibiotic timing, discharge education, and hypothermic event monitoring.
				</p>
				<p>Some technologies I am most proficient with include: <br> <a

					href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/">Snowflake</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>, <a

				<div class=""></div>
				</p>
				<p>On a more personal level, I love sports. Particularly, hockey and soccer which I played competitively
					throughout my youth. Beyond being my place of peace, sports has shaped my appreciation for teamwork, taught resilience,
					and inspires my love for continuously trying to be the best version of myself. This passion has also bled into the world 
					of fantasy sports, a unique way for me to combine my analytical side and love for sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also love staying connected to friends through on activities, music, and drinks/food!

				</p>
				<p>"It takes a village to raise a child" is an African proverb and one of my favourite quotes. A big
					believer in the value of team and surrounding myself with outstanding people, I strive to be that
					excellent team member or friend that everyone is grateful to have.

				<p>
					With the recent implementation of the 3-2-1-0 points system in the PWHL it is forgotten that during the 04-05 NHL lockout this was also a topic in discussion. 
					In my personal exploratory data analysis project I used python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) to clean, merge, and analyze 
					how things might have been different if the NHL had also implemented a 3-2-1-0 points system.
					Linked <a href="https://github.com/Brendanlai/nhl_data_analytics/tree/main">here</a> is my project currently on github including the data processing, analysis, and visualizations.

				<p>My final capstone project was proposed by myself and completed alongisde 5 other outstanding
					individuals. We developed an autonomous robotic foosball opponent which anyone could walk up and
					play against. Below is a demo video of our project on the final presentation day.

				<p>In my third year capstone project myself and a five others created overlap. Overlap is a Spotify
					integrated web application that collects the users listening data creating fun visualizations for
					the user to understand their own listening habits. The other key feature we built was the group
					sharing capabilities to compare your listening habits to your friends. You can view the project
					source code <a href="https://github.com/IGEN330-Overlap/Overlap">here</a> and learn more about it in

				<p>For my second year capstone project I alongside my team designed a solar powered path/street light.
					Unfortunately, we were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and shifted towards developing a full
					scale CAD model. As team lead for Solit I was responible for CAD reviews and lead the system
					simulation. The other notable contribution I made was programming components such as our data logger
					and battery and solar management system.
